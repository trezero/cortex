# Archon Extension Sync

Synchronizes local Claude Code **skills**, **commands**, and **plugins** with the Archon extension registry. Detects drift, handles conflict resolution, installs pending extensions, and uploads new local extensions across all extension types.

**Invocation:** `/archon-extension-sync`
**Auto-trigger:** Runs automatically when any Archon extension detects last_extension_sync > 24h in `.claude/archon-state.json`

---

## Phase 0: Compute Machine Fingerprint

### 0a. Gather system info

```bash
hostname
```

```bash
whoami
```

```bash
uname -s
```

### 0b. Compute fingerprint

Concatenate: `<hostname>|<username>|<os>` and compute SHA256:

```bash
echo -n "$(hostname)|$(whoami)|$(uname -s)" | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1
```

Store as `system_fingerprint`.

---

## Phase 1: Scan Local Extensions

Initialize an empty `local_extensions` list: `[{name, content_hash, type, source_path, local_mtime}]`

### 1a. Determine install scope

Read `.claude/archon-config.json` if it exists (fall back to `~/.claude/archon-config.json`). Extract:
- `install_scope` -> `<install_scope>` (may be absent)

Determine `<install_dir>`:
- If `<install_scope>` is `"global"` -> `~/.claude`
- Otherwise (including `"project"` or absent) -> `.claude`

### 1b. Find all skill definition files

Scan these directories for SKILL.md files:
- `<install_dir>/skills/` (user-installed skills)
- `integrations/claude-code/extensions/` (repo skills, if in Archon repo)
- Any directory listed in `.claude/archon-state.json` under `extension_directories`

```
Glob: <install_dir>/skills/**/SKILL.md
Glob: integrations/claude-code/extensions/**/SKILL.md
```

### 1c. Parse each skill

For each SKILL.md file found:
1. Read the file content
2. Parse YAML frontmatter to extract `name`
3. Compute SHA256 hash of the full content:
   ```bash
   sha256sum <filepath> | cut -d' ' -f1
   ```
4. Get the file's last modification time as a Unix timestamp (integer seconds since epoch):
   ```bash
   date -r <filepath> +%s
   ```
   (Works on both Linux and macOS. On Windows use PowerShell: `[int](Get-Item '<filepath>').LastWriteTimeUtc.Subtract([datetime]'1970-01-01').TotalSeconds`)
5. Add to `local_extensions`: `{name, content_hash, type: "skill", source_path, local_mtime: <integer>}`

### 1d. Find all command files

Scan for command `.md` files:
- `<install_dir>/commands/` (user-installed commands)
- `.claude/commands/` (project-level commands, if different from install_dir)
- `integrations/claude-code/commands/` (repo commands, if in Archon repo)

```
Glob: <install_dir>/commands/**/*.md
Glob: .claude/commands/**/*.md
Glob: integrations/claude-code/commands/**/*.md
```

Deduplicate by absolute path (project and install_dir may overlap).

### 1e. Parse each command

For each command `.md` file found:
1. Read the file content
2. Derive the command name from its path:
   - Root-level file (e.g. `commands/commit.md`): name = `commit`
   - Grouped file (e.g. `commands/archon/archon-prime.md`): name = `archon-prime`
   - Grouped file where stem doesn't include group (e.g. `commands/archon/rca.md`): name = `archon-rca`
   - Nested deeper (e.g. `commands/core_piv_loop/plan-feature.md`): name = `core_piv_loop-plan-feature`
3. Compute SHA256 hash of the full content:
   ```bash
   sha256sum <filepath> | cut -d' ' -f1
   ```
4. Get the file's last modification time as a Unix timestamp (integer seconds since epoch):
   ```bash
   date -r <filepath> +%s
   ```
   (Works on both Linux and macOS. On Windows use PowerShell: `[int](Get-Item '<filepath>').LastWriteTimeUtc.Subtract([datetime]'1970-01-01').TotalSeconds`)
5. Add to `local_extensions`: `{name, content_hash, type: "command", source_path, local_mtime: <integer>}`

### 1f. Find all plugin directories

Scan for plugin manifest files:
- `<install_dir>/plugins/*/` (user-installed plugins — look for `.mcp.json` or `.claude-plugin/`)
- `integrations/claude-code/plugins/*/` (repo plugins, if in Archon repo)

```
Glob: <install_dir>/plugins/*/.mcp.json
Glob: integrations/claude-code/plugins/*/.mcp.json
```

Exclude Claude Code internal files (`blocklist.json`, `installed_plugins.json`, `cache/`, `data/`, `marketplaces/`, `known_marketplaces.json`, `install-counts-cache.json`).

### 1g. Parse each plugin

For each plugin directory found (containing `.mcp.json`):
1. Read the `.mcp.json` file content
2. Derive the plugin name from the directory name (e.g. `plugins/archon-memory/` -> `archon-memory`)
3. Compute a combined SHA256 hash of `.mcp.json` content:
   ```bash
   sha256sum <plugin_dir>/.mcp.json | cut -d' ' -f1
   ```
4. Get the manifest's last modification time as a Unix timestamp (integer seconds since epoch):
   ```bash
   date -r <plugin_dir>/.mcp.json +%s
   ```
   (Works on both Linux and macOS. On Windows use PowerShell: `[int](Get-Item '<plugin_dir>\.mcp.json').LastWriteTimeUtc.Subtract([datetime]'1970-01-01').TotalSeconds`)
5. Add to `local_extensions`: `{name, content_hash, type: "plugin", source_path, local_mtime: <integer>}`

**Note:** Plugins are complex multi-file structures (Python code, MCP servers, hooks). The sync tracks them by their `.mcp.json` manifest hash for drift detection. Full plugin content sync (uploading all plugin files) is not yet supported — only metadata registration and drift alerts.

### 1h. Summary before sync

Log the scan results:
> "Scanned local extensions: <N> skills, <M> commands, <P> plugins"

---

## Phase 2: Sync with Archon

### 2a. Read project state

Read `.claude/archon-state.json` for `archon_project_id`.

If no project ID:
> "No Archon project linked. Run `/link-to-project` first to associate this repo with an Archon project."

Stop here.

### 2b. Call sync

```
manage_extensions(
    action="sync",
    local_extensions=<local_extensions list>,
    system_fingerprint="<fingerprint>",
    project_id="<archon_project_id>"
)
```

### 2c. Handle first-time registration

If response has `system.is_new == true`:

Ask the user:
> "This is the first time this machine is connecting to Archon. What name should we use for this system?"
>
> Suggestion: `<hostname>`

Store the user's choice, then re-call:
```
manage_extensions(
    action="sync",
    local_extensions=<local_extensions list>,
    system_fingerprint="<fingerprint>",
    system_name="<user-provided-name>",
    project_id="<archon_project_id>"
)
```

---

## Phase 3: Process Sync Results

### 3a. Install pending extensions

For each item in `pending_install`:
1. Check the `type` field to determine where to write:
   - **`type == "command"`**: Read `plugin_manifest` for `command_group` and `filename`. Write `content` to `<install_dir>/commands/{command_group}/{filename}` (create directory if needed). If no `command_group`, write to `<install_dir>/commands/{filename}`.
   - **`type == "skill"`** (or absent): Write `content` to `<install_dir>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   - **`type == "plugin"`**: Log a notice — plugin installation requires manual setup. Report the plugin name and suggest the user install it from the repo.
2. Report: "Installed {type}: <name>"

### 3b. Remove pending extensions

For each item in `pending_remove`:
1. Check the `type` field:
   - **`type == "command"`**: Read `plugin_manifest` for path info. Delete `<install_dir>/commands/{command_group}/{filename}` (or `<install_dir>/commands/{filename}`).
   - **`type == "skill"`** (or absent): Delete `<install_dir>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
   - **`type == "plugin"`**: Log a notice — plugin removal requires manual cleanup. Report the plugin name.
2. Report: "Removed {type}: <name>"

### 3c. Resolve local changes

The `direction` field in each `local_changes` item indicates which copy is newer:
- `local_newer` — local file mtime is later than Archon's `updated_at`
- `archon_newer` — Archon's `updated_at` is later than local file mtime
- `conflict` — timestamps are within the clock-skew threshold (genuine ambiguity)
- `unknown` — one or both timestamps were not available

Format timestamps for display: convert `local_mtime` (Unix seconds) and `archon_updated_at` (ISO string) to human-readable UTC dates.

**For `direction == "local_newer"`:**

> "Extension **<name>** ({type}): your local copy is newer (local: `<local date>`, Archon last updated: `<archon date>`).
> **Recommended: Push local version to Archon.**
> Choose: [Push to Archon] / [Keep Archon version] / [Skip]"

- **Push to Archon:** Read local file content, then:
  ```
  manage_extensions(action="upload", extension_content="<local content>", extension_type="<type>")
  ```
- **Keep Archon version:** Fetch Archon version via `find_extensions(extension_id="<extension_id>")` and overwrite local file.
- **Skip:** Leave both as-is and continue.

**For `direction == "archon_newer"`:**

> "Extension **<name>** ({type}): Archon has a newer version (Archon last updated: `<archon date>`, local: `<local date>`).
> **Recommended: Pull from Archon (update local file).**
> Choose: [Pull from Archon] / [Keep local version] / [Skip]"

- **Pull from Archon:** Fetch Archon version via `find_extensions(extension_id="<extension_id>")` and overwrite local file.
- **Keep local version:** Read local file content, then push to Archon:
  ```
  manage_extensions(action="upload", extension_content="<local content>", extension_type="<type>")
  ```
- **Skip:** Leave both as-is and continue.

**For `direction == "conflict"` or `direction == "unknown"`:**

> "Extension **<name>** ({type}) has diverged (local hash: `<local_hash>`, Archon hash: `<archon_hash>`). Unable to determine which is newer. What would you like to do?"

Options:
- **Update Source** — Push local content to Archon as a new version
- **Save as Project Version** — Store as a project-specific override
- **Create New Extension** — Upload as a new extension with a different name
- **Discard Changes** — Overwrite local with Archon version

**If Update Source:**
Read the local file content, then:
```
manage_extensions(action="upload", extension_content="<local content>", extension_type="<type>")
```

**If Save as Project Version:**
Read the local file content. The backend stores it as a project override (future API call).

**If Create New Extension:**
Ask for a new name, then:
```
manage_extensions(action="validate", extension_content="<local content>")
```
If validation passes:
```
manage_extensions(action="upload", extension_content="<local content>", extension_name="<new-name>", extension_type="<type>")
```

**If Discard Changes:**
Fetch the Archon version via `find_extensions(extension_id="<extension_id>")` and overwrite the local file.

### 3d. Handle unknown local extensions

For each item in `unknown_local`, ask the user:

> "Found local {type} **<name>** not in Archon. Would you like to upload it to the registry?"

Options:
- **Upload** — Validate and upload
- **Skip** — Leave as local-only

**If Upload:**
Read the local file, then:
```
manage_extensions(action="validate", extension_content="<content>")
```
If validation passes (or user accepts warnings):
```
manage_extensions(action="upload", extension_content="<content>", extension_type="<type>")
```
If validation has errors, show them and ask user to fix.

**Note for plugins:** Since plugins are multi-file, uploading only registers the plugin metadata (name and `.mcp.json` manifest). The full plugin source lives in the repo and must be distributed via git.

---

## Phase 4: Update State

### 4a. Write sync timestamp

Update `.claude/archon-state.json`:
```json
{
  "last_extension_sync": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "system_fingerprint": "<fingerprint>",
  "system_name": "<name>"
}
```

Merge with existing state — do not overwrite other fields.

### 4b. Summary

> "**Extension sync complete:**
> - Scanned: <N> skills, <M> commands, <P> plugins
> - In sync: <count>
> - Installed: <list or 'none'>
> - Removed: <list or 'none'>
> - Updated: <list or 'none'>
> - Uploaded: <list or 'none'>
> - Skipped: <list or 'none'>"

---

## Important Notes

### Sync Freshness

Other Archon extensions check sync freshness in their Phase 0:
```
Read .claude/archon-state.json
If last_extension_sync is missing or older than 24h:
  -> Run /archon-extension-sync before continuing
```

### Extension File Locations

**Skills:**
- Installed: `<install_dir>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
  - Project scope: `.claude/skills/`
  - Global scope: `~/.claude/skills/`
- Repo source: `integrations/claude-code/extensions/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Identified by: YAML frontmatter `name` field

**Commands:**
- Installed: `<install_dir>/commands/{group}/{filename}.md` or `<install_dir>/commands/{filename}.md`
- Project-level: `.claude/commands/{group}/{filename}.md`
- Repo source: `integrations/claude-code/commands/{group}/{filename}.md`
- Identified by: file path (group + filename stem)

**Plugins:**
- Installed: `<install_dir>/plugins/<name>/` (directory with `.mcp.json`)
- Repo source: `integrations/claude-code/plugins/<name>/`
- Identified by: directory name containing `.mcp.json`
- Sync scope: metadata tracking only (drift detection via `.mcp.json` hash)

### Error Recovery

- If Archon is unreachable, skip sync and continue with stale state
- If a single extension install/upload fails, continue with remaining operations
- Always save the sync timestamp even if some operations failed (prevents retry loops)
